a script that uses PIL to perform the following operations:

Iterate through each file in the folder
For each file:
  Rotate the image 90Â° clockwise
  Resize the image from 192x192 to 128x128
  Save the image to a new folder in .jpeg format
Use a nano editor for this purpose. You can name the file however you'd like. And make sure to save the updated images in the folder: /opt/icons/
